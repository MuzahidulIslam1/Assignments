    "Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to \"learn\" from data, without being explicitly programmed. The learning process involves the identification of patterns and relationships in data, and the use of this information to make predictions or decisions. The goal of machine learning is to build models that can generalize from the examples in the training data to new, unseen examples. Machine learning has applications in a wide range of areas, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, robotics, and more."

    "A labeled training set is a collection of data that is used to train a machine learning algorithm. Each data point in the training set consists of a set of features, or inputs, and a label, or output. The label represents the true target value or class that the algorithm is trying to predict. For example, in a binary classification problem, the label could be \"1\" for positive class and \"0\" for negative class.\n",

This is typically done by optimizing a loss function, which measures the difference between the algorithm's predictions and the true labels.
